# Data Science Swirl Course
This is a repository for a Swirl course for introductory econometrics

You can install and run this course in R by:

1. Installing the swirl package with `install.packages('swirl')`
2. Loading up the swirl package with `library(swirl)`
3. Installing this course with `install_course_github('big-data-and-economics','ECON368-R-Swirls')`
4. Running swirl with `swirl()` and picking the Econometrics course.

This is being designed to fit in with my particular class, which follows Bailey's "Real Econometrics". However, if you would like to contribute, perhaps to add topics I don't cover or to adjust some of the content that's there, you're free to do so!

These Swirls are forked from Nick Huntington-Klein's repository of assignments.
